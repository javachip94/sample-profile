<!--Unordered List and Paragraphs-->
<p> My name is Susmita.  I am currently a Teaching Fellow for Kindergarten at a private school.  I love teaching Kindergarten because I get to watch the students grow so much during the school year.  Although I love teaching Kindergarten, being a teacher is not something that I can see myself doing forever so I am trying to make a career change by learning how to code! 
During my free time I love to travel and try new foods.  One of my goals in life is to travel to as many different parts of the worlds as I can and to try as many different types of foods possible.  Some of the places I have recently traveled to are Bangladesh, Baltimore, Phoenix, Denver, and Washington, D.C.! </p>
